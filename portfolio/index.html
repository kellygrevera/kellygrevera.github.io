            Hello, I am Kelly Grevera, an aspiring artist. I am a student specializing in new media and digital design with a concentration in commerce, and I am currently learning HTML and CSS. I am passionate about learning how to create aesthetic work to enhance user experience. I strive to create art through storytelling and am excited to develop coding skills that could improve my work in the future through hands-on work and projects.
